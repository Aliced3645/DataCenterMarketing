Whats new in ``pycap`` 0.1.5
----------------------------
* Packet injection works for Ethernet, ARP, IP and TCP.
* Capture objects can be used as an iterator allowing code such as the following:

  >>> import pycap.capture
  >>> capture = pycap.capture.capture()
  >>> for packet in capture:
  ...   print packet
  >>>

* ``pycap.constants`` package that contains constants for various protocols.
