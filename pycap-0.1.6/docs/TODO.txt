* Get compilation under Python 2.2 working again.
* Finish support for packet construction and injection via libnet_.  All protocols
  except UDP and ICMP are implemented, but need more testing.
* Support more protocol types, such as DNS_ and IPv6_.
* Test on more architectures.  Currently tested on Mac OS X/PPC and
  Linux/x86.
* Write full documentation for the module.
* Come up with better system for documentation.
* Make this work on Windows.  I briefly struggled with compiling using VC7 under Win XP
  using winpcap_ and LibnetNT_.  No luck, and was getting some rather interesting errors
  about missing header files which appeared to be where they should be :-/.
